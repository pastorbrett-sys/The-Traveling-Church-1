# Vagabond Bible - Native App Development Plan

**Last Updated:** January 8, 2026  
**Status:** In Progress - App Store Connect Setup Next

---

## Current Session Progress

**✅ Phase 1 Complete:** RevenueCat fully configured with:
- iOS & Android apps (API keys stored)
- "Vagabond Bible Pro" entitlement
- 3 subscription tiers: Monthly, Yearly, Lifetime
- Default offering with all packages linked

**🔄 Next Steps (in order):**
1. Phase 2: App Store Connect Setup (iOS) ← **In Progress**
2. Phase 3: Google Play Console Setup (Android)
3. Phase 5: Backend Integration (webhook + sync)

**📋 Approach:** Complete external platform setup first (Apple/Google), then build backend to match exact configurations.

**⏳ Current Blockers:**

| Platform | Blocker | What's Needed | ETA |
|----------|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Apple** | Bank verification pending | Wait ~24 hours, then complete W-9, then Paid Apps Agreement activates | ~24-48 hours |
| **Google** | APK required for subscriptions | Must upload APK to internal testing before subscription creation unlocks | After app build |

**Apple Sequential Process:**
1. ⏳ Bank account verification (~24 hours processing) ← CURRENT
2. Then: W-9 tax form submission (unlocks after banking approved)
3. Then: Paid Apps Agreement becomes Active
4. Then: In-App Purchase capability can be enabled on Bundle ID
5. Then: Create subscription products in App Store Connect

**Google Sequential Process:**
1. ✅ App created in Google Play Console
2. ✅ Merchant/payments profile set up (pending small deposit verification)
3. ⏳ Upload APK to internal testing ← BLOCKED (need to build app first)
4. Then: Create subscription products

**Status:** Moving to Phase 5 (Backend Integration) while waiting on platform verifications.
