This platform connects men with spiritual counselors for honest, faith-based conversations about the issues men face.

Three subscription tiers:
	•	Basic: $50 per month, 1 session
	•	Standard: $100 per month, 2 sessions
	•	Premium: $200 per month, 3 sessions

The system must be automated, low maintenance, and mobile-friendly. Everything should function without manual intervention once deployed.

User flow:
	1.	Landing page shows the mission “Meet with spiritual men who get it.” and the three subscription options.
	2.	Each tier has a “Join Now” button linking directly to Stripe Checkout.
	3.	After payment, user automatically receives a welcome email with a booking link (Calendly or TidyCal) and an optional intake form (Google Form or Typeform).
	4.	User books a session via Calendly. Calendly generates a Zoom or Google Meet link and syncs with the counselor’s Google Calendar.
	5.	Stripe renews payments monthly. Zapier sends automated reminder emails telling the user to book their next session.
	6.	Optionally, the user receives a Telegram or Discord group invite after their first payment.

Tech stack to use:
	•	Frontend: Carrd.co or a minimal React site (dark, mobile-optimized).
	•	Payments and billing: Stripe Checkout + Stripe Billing for recurring subscriptions.
	•	Scheduling: Calendly or TidyCal integrated with Google Calendar.
	•	Email automation: MailerLite or ConvertKit for welcome and reminder emails.
	•	Automation layer: Zapier or Make to connect Stripe → Email → Booking.
	•	Video calls: Zoom or Google Meet.
	•	Optional community: Telegram or Discord.
	•	Optional backend: Node.js Express API only if needed for webhooks.

Automation flows:
	1.	Stripe → Welcome Email
	•	Trigger: successful Stripe payment.
	•	Actions: add user to MailerLite list, send welcome email with booking link, send Telegram or Discord invite.
	2.	Stripe → Monthly Reminder
	•	Trigger: Stripe subscription renewal.
	•	Actions: send reminder email with booking link.
	3.	Booking Confirmation
	•	Trigger: user books via Calendly.
	•	Actions: auto-generate meeting link, send confirmation to user and counselor.

Website structure:
	•	Hero section with headline “Meet With Spiritual Men Who Get It.” and button “Join Now.”
	•	Tier section showing $50 / $100 / $200 options, each linking to Stripe Checkout.
	•	Optional testimonials section with placeholder quotes.
	•	FAQ section covering how sessions work, cancellation (allowed anytime), and rescheduling (via booking link).
	•	Footer with contact email and copyright.

Technical notes:
	•	Do not build a complex backend. Use hosted Stripe checkout, Calendly, and MailerLite.
	•	Keep frontend static and fast. If React is used, deploy via Vercel or Replit hosting.
	•	Optional webhook endpoint: /api/webhooks/stripe to handle checkout.session.completed, invoice.payment_succeeded, and customer.subscription.deleted events.
	•	Store subscription status in a lightweight JSON file or simple database such as Supabase or Firebase.

Development tasks:
	•	Build landing page with Stripe buttons.
	•	Configure Stripe recurring plans.
	•	Add Calendly or TidyCal booking link.
	•	Set up automation flow Stripe → MailerLite → Email via Zapier.
	•	Optionally add Telegram invite step.
	•	Test payment, email, and booking automation.
	•	Deploy to live domain.

Deployment plan:
	•	Host site on Replit, Vercel, or Carrd.
	•	Connect custom domain and enable SSL.
	•	Test Stripe sandbox payments and verify emails.
	•	Launch with live Stripe keys once tested.

Rules for Replit:
	1.	Do not hardcode fake users or mock bookings.
	2.	Do not add demo payments. Use Stripe test mode only for verification.
	3.	Do not build dashboards or admin panels.
	4.	All automations must function without manual edits.
	5.	Store all API keys in the .env file.

Deliverables:
	1.	Functional MVP with landing page, Stripe integration, automated emails, and booking system.
	2.	Documentation including README setup guide, environment variable list, and instructions on updating prices or URLs.
