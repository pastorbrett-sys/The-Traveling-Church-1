DO NOT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN EXACTLY WHAT IS WRITTEN BELOW.
DO NOT ADD EXTRA FEATURES. DO NOT REFACTOR. DO NOT CHANGE STYLING SITEWIDE.
DO NOT TOUCH ANY OTHER PAGES EXCEPT WHAT I SPECIFY.
ONLY IMPLEMENT THE DAF GIVING PAGE + THE SMALL PROGRAMS PAGE SECTION + OPTIONAL HEADER/FOOTER LINK.
REPEAT: ONLY THESE CHANGES.

GOAL
Create a dedicated “DAF Giving” page for The Traveling Church (Donor-Advised Funds), and add a small, clean section on the existing Programs page that links to it. This is NOT a new program. It is a giving method page.

SCOPE (REQUIRED)
1) Create new page route: /donor-advised-funds
   - (Optional alias route if easy): /daf
2) Update Programs page (/programs) ONLY:
   - Add a small section near the bottom titled “Donor-Advised Funds (DAF)”
   - 1–2 sentence blurb + a single CTA button linking to /donor-advised-funds
   - DO NOT add a new program tile/card
3) Optional (nice-to-have, only if trivial):
   - Add a simple footer link “DAF Giving” -> /donor-advised-funds
   - Do NOT add to main nav unless we already have a nav pattern for “Ways to Give”

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Must match existing site look and feel (fonts, spacing, colors, button style).
- Keep it “corporate clean” and minimal.
- Mobile-first, responsive.
- No long walls of text. Use short paragraphs + bullet lists.
- Add a small Traveling Church icon watermark/placement if we already do this elsewhere; if not, skip.
- Absolutely no popups.

IMPORTANT:
