Animal Conservation & Creation Care Program
Program Overview

The Traveling Church’s Animal Conservation & Creation Care Program exists to protect and steward God’s creation by supporting ethical animal care, conservation efforts, and sustainable coexistence between communities and wildlife.

We believe caring for animals is part of faithful stewardship—honoring life, preserving ecosystems, and acting responsibly toward the world entrusted to us.

What the Program Supports

This program focuses on practical, ethical conservation, including:

Support for wildlife protection and habitat preservation

Aid for animals affected by conflict, disaster, or environmental degradation

Partnerships with local organizations providing humane animal care

Education and community initiatives that promote responsible stewardship

Sustainable practices that protect both people and wildlife

All efforts prioritize dignity, sustainability, and long-term impact rather than short-term activism.

How We Work

We partner with local conservation groups, veterinarians, and community leaders in regions where the Traveling Church operates. Rather than imposing outside solutions, we support locally informed efforts that respect cultural context and ecological balance.

When appropriate, animal care is integrated alongside humanitarian aid—recognizing that animal welfare and human well-being are often deeply connected.

Why It Matters

Scripture calls us to care for creation, not exploit it. Protecting animals and ecosystems:

Preserves livelihoods for vulnerable communities

Prevents long-term environmental harm

Reflects responsible stewardship and compassion

Honors God’s creation through action, not ideology

This program is rooted in responsibility, not politics—and compassion, not spectacle.

Use of Funds

Donations to the Animal Conservation & Creation Care Program may be used for:

Direct conservation and animal care efforts

Emergency response for animals affected by crisis

Support of vetted local partners and initiatives

Supplies, transport, and basic operational needs related to conservation work

Funds are deployed carefully, transparently, and in alignment with the Traveling Church’s mission.
